The file `data/image_database.csv` describes the .tif files of anemone nematocysts provided for the challenge. Currently, the database covers only images in the folders (all paths relative to the `HACKATHON` folder found on the "everything" drive):

- `Streamline process/measured`
- `Search engine/test`

For each image, the database currently contains:

- *path* The path to the file, relative the `HACKATHON` folder provided for the challenge. You'll likely recognize the address of images your working.
- *taxa* The genus and/or species of the pictured nematocyst.
- *specimen* The specimen identifier
- *tissue* The tissue type of the image

# TODO
- Add available metadata xml files for each tif
- Add length and width for measured files
- What do you need???
